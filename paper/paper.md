# Author contributions

PB had been the architect of PyMPDATA v1 with SA taking the role of main developer and maintainer over the time.
MO participated in the package core development and led the works on the condensational-growth example which was the basis of his MSc thesis.
JB contributed the DPDC algorithm variant handling.
SD contributed the advection-diffusion example.
MM contributed to the numba-mpi package.
PR contributed the shallow-water example.
MS contributed the advection-on-a-sphere example
